## Light Blue Bean:
### Scratch Data : 
We are using Scratch Service and five scratch characteristics to store data on the bean side and request the service from the mobile end, those are the numbers the central client ( Mobile ) would need to get the stored data. We can agree on which data value (from sensors) would be assigned to each characteristic. 

The number that changes in UUID is a495ff`21`-c5b1-4b44-b512-1370f02d74de

#### Scratch Service UUID: `a495ff20-c5b1-4b44-b512-1370f02d74de`
